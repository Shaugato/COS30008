Data Structures and Patterns


1.The unit aims to study the design, implementation, and application of data structures for algorithmic problem solving.

2.The study is focused on effective problem expression, suitable data representations, and the impact of data and its representation on time and space consumption.

3.We will be able to apply object-oriented design and implementation techniques, interpret trade-offs, design and evaluate software solutions using software design patterns, explain data structure purposes, and assess their impact on algorithms.

4.We will also be able to analyze algorithm designs and perform best, average, and worst-case analysis.
